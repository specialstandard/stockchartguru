<b>The Top 10 Reasons Women Are Better Stock Traders Than Men</b><br><br>

<b>10. Less Testosterone</b><br><br>

Science has proven that the hormone, testosterone is responsible for aggression and risky behavior. This hormone appears in humans in very different quantities between the sexes. In fact, men produce as much as 10 times as much testosterone as women.<br><br>

<b>9. No Penis Envy</b><br><br>

Women are far less likely to get into an egotistical or macho competition when it comes to trading stocks. They have nothing to prove so they are better able to focus on making profitable stock trades.<br><br>

<b>8. Better Household Product Knowledge</b><br><br>

The vast majority of the S&P 500 stocks, Dow Jones Industrial stocks and most Fortune 500 stocks trades on both the NYSE as well as the NASDAQ are products readily consumed in and around the home. As women are far more likely, statistically to be familiar with these household products and therefore brands and companies, women are much better at determining the value of these stocks and trading them.<br><br>

<b>7. Higher Social Intelligence</b><br><br>

Whether it comes to Fundamental or Technical stock trading, there is always a psychological element to trading these stocks which women excel at due to there inclination to have a higher social intelligence.<br><br>

<b>6. Targeted By Advertisers</b><br><br>

It is a well known fact that marketers target women as the primary purchaser of most consumer goods. It stands to reason that women are far more familiar with these products being advertised toward them and are therefore better at trading them on the stock market.<br><br>

<b>5. Better At Networking</b><br><br>

Women have a much wider network of female and male friends and family. They are more likely to keep in touch with old college friends and aquaintances. This ability to amass a much larger network of friends and business partners than men, allows women to have more inside knowledge and information which in turn helps women to make better stock trades.<br><br>

<b>4. More Empathetic</b><br><br>

Women have a higher emotional intelligence and are able to predict the direction of the stock market with much more accuracy, historically speaking, than men.<br><br>

<b>3. More Risk Averse</b><br><br>

Due to the reduced presence of the hormone, testosterone, in women's bodies, they are less likely to engage in risky behaviors when it comes to driving, business, or even stock trading. This conservative approach has helped women acchieve much higher returns than men in the stock market.<br><br>

<b>2. More Nurturing</b><br><br>

Because of their more empathetic, and social nature, women are far more nurturing than men which allows them to make more profitable trades without letting aggression or male ego interfere with the bottom line.<br><br>

<b>1. Able To Dissociate From The Money</b><br><br>

Because most women didn't actually have to earn the money they use to trade stocks, it doesn't have as much sentimental value as it does for men. This allows women to far outperform men in trading stocks because they keep a more objective view than men.
