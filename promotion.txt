I don't know anything about the stock market but this is a fun little game where you get to pretend you do.

My high score so far is $100,000.
When I get to a million I'm quitting my day job lol

My girlfriend challenges my manhood picking these stocks.

She says she got the 2nd highest score on this http://stockchartguru.com stock chart simulator/game.
I told her technical analysis is voodoo economics (is it?)
What is a good technical analysis technique or pattern (if it exists) I can use to build my portfolio so I can rub it in her stupid, beautiful face?
Or should I just stick to a good no-load mutual fund index or value investing?

Right now I'm trying to look for bull flags or buy the dip on rising stocks with mixed success.
Any ideas?

The high score on stockchartguru.com is over $2 Million Dollars.

He just got lucky, right?
There's no way you can consistently profit using technical analysis on stock charts, right?
