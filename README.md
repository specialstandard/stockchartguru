Are you a stock chart guru?
Can you predict the direction of a stock price and build the value of your portfolio up over a million dollars?

Each chart you are presented with is randomly taken from an actual daily chart of a real Fortune 500 company stock which has traded within the last 10 years up until the present day.

The specific year of the stock is not displayed, however, the month and day are listed on the stock chart to help give you an indication of the season of the year.
